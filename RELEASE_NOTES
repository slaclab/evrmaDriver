 Release Notes for the evrmaDriver package
-------------------------------------------

evrmaDriver-R1-0-p6: 2016-04-18 K. Kim
	* implement temperature reading
	* print out firmware version inot hw_info virtual file

evrmaDriver-R1-0-p5: 2016-03-24 K. Kim

	* update pci-id table to support MRF PMC EVR-230/300
          for earlier linux kernel version than 3.8
		- src/pci-evr.c

	* fix interrupt handling:  
		- src/evr-irq-event.c

	1. DUBF interrupt: read out data buffer first than clear the interrupt
		- If we clear interrupt first, the interrupt will be occured again
		  during read out the buffer. It could make duplicated interrupt,
		  and we see the symptom in SLAC-EVR. The second interrupt (duplicated
                  interrupt) will give invalid data buffer, and NO_DATA error on user space.
		- SLAC EVR has slightly different interupt clearing mechanism.
		  We need to set DBUF bit in IRQ status register first then need to unset the bit.
		  MRF EVR doesn't require the second step (unset the bit).

	2. FIFO event interrupt: readout event from FIFO until the FIFO is empty
				 then clear the interrupt
		- If we clear interrupt first, it immediately generate another interrupt due to the
		  FIFO is still no empty.
		- So, we need to read out FIFO until the FIFO is empty, then need to clear the interupt
		- it give us another benefit for system performance.
		  Since, most of events (except event#1) are occured almost same time, So, we can handle
		  most of events at one interrupt.

	3. FIFO full interrupt: handle and notify first then clear the interrupt

	4. Other interrupt: clear interrupt first then handle it

evrmaDriver-R1-0-p4: 2015-11-18 S. Gruden
	* Enabled DBG_MEASURE_TIME_FROM_IRQ_TO_USER.

evrmaDriver-R1-0-p3: 2015-11-13 S. Gruden
	* a bug fix (output allocating was not correctly protected)
	* code cleanup

evrmaDriver-R1-0-p2: 2015-11-09 S. Gruden
	* added RELEASE_NOTES

evrmaDriver-R1-0-p1: 2015-11-05 S. Gruden
	* added description of /sys/class/modac-virt/vevrX/config
	* rewritten the direct access lock
	* bug fix: proper VIRT_DEV cleanup
	* code cleanup (reordered declarations and definitions, added 'inline' 
	  keyword when appropriate, removed unnecessary frames on stack,
	  using enums to increase readability, ...)

evrmaDriver-R1-0: 2015-11-05 S. Gruden
	* Initial release
